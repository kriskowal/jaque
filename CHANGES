History
-------

0.1.18
 - Synchronized dependencies for bug fix in IO stream close method.

0.1.17
 - Switched internal MIME extension checker to use the "mime"
   NPM package, which appears to be more thorough on close inspection.
 - Took advantage of Q-HTTP's ability to handle a promised body
   in the static file endware.

0.1.16
 - Synchronized dependency for q-fs bug fix for binary encoding.

0.1.12
 - Added ``Headers`` middleware for adding headers unspecified by an
   application.
 - Coordinated dependency revisions.
 - Fixed a bug in the file server; 404 responses are now delivered promptly.

0.1.11
 - Added ``text/cache-manifest`` to the ``.manifest`` MIME mapping.

0.1.10
 - WARNING: Removed ``ContentLength`` until further notice.  It is
   presently broken.
 - Consolidated all content negotiation under a single implementation
   and expanded the negotiable parameters to include:
    - ``ContentType``
    - ``Language``
    - ``Charset``
    - ``Encoding``
    - ``Host``
 - Host "negotiation" is now predicated on the host name and the port,
   separated by colons, and negotiation wildcards are accepted.
 - Added ``Select`` negotiation, wherein an app is selected and
   returned by a given function.
 - Added alternate log function and timestamp function parameters
   to Log middleware.
 - Redirectors now accept a default redirect to the same path, which
   is useful for a ``GET`` following a ``PUT`` or ``POST``.
 - Aliased the ``ok`` application maker to ``content``.  Both names
   will remain going forward.
 - Applications now receive and are obligated to route the response
   object in addition to the request object.
 - Renamed End route to Cap route. End is now deprecated.
 - Renamed PostContent and PostJson to ContentRequest and JsonRequest
   respectively.  The old names are depreacted aliases.
 - Added ``Time`` Middleware
 - Added ``visitor`` and ``tabs`` parameters, as in
   ``JSON.stringify``, to the ``Json`` middleware.
 - Withdrew ambition to implement pattern matcher; someone else's job.
 - Withdrew ambition to implement FileOverlay; better supported by
   chaining FileTree middleware end to end.
